# **Autocomplete-Typing**

Project 6 out of 30 mini projects written from scratch using only HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 vanillaJS.

This project consists in creating a type-ahead/auto-complete form, that suggests results on user input. The final result looks like this:

![alt text]()


### HTML

The structure of the project is really easy going. A simple form containing an input text where the user will insert the US state of city being searched and an unordered list where we will display the list of cities or states.

```HTML
<form class="search-form">

  <input type="text" class="search" placeholder="City or State"></input>
  <ul class="suggestions">
    <li>Filter by city</li>
    <li>or state</li>
  </ul>

</form>
```
